          <h1>New Number, Who Dis?</h1>
            <p>Hi! I'm PackedMOL, some guy doing guy things in here. <br><br>I created this site as a personal
            side project. <br><br> Anyways, I like to do art, code sometimes, make video games on the rare ocassion, and run <b> DUNGEONS
            AND DRAGONS</b> for my friends. <br><br> This site is mostly for personal stuff I find cool but I'll
            definitely also be info dumping on my DMing shenanigans and other things. I'll also be showcasing pieces of art and
            other demented things that some of my friends make, like the <b>banner</b> above<br><br>I'm making this site completely
            from scratch so it might
            be a while before it looks uber cool...BUT IT WILL. Trust.<br><br>
