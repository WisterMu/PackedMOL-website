    <p>Hi! I'm PackedMOL, some 20 year old dude doing dude things in here. <br><br>I created this site as a personal side project and also something I could add to my porfolio in the future. I'm one of the dreaded and horrifying <b>Computer Science Majors</b>... <br> ik scary right. Never thought you'd find one here. Muahahahahahaha! <br><br> Anyways, I like to do art, code sometimes, make video games on the rare ocassion, and run <b> DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS</b> for my friends. <br><br> This site is mostly for personal stuff I find cool but I'll definitely also be info dumping on my DMing shenanigans.<br><br><b> <u>STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION </u></b>. Likely for a long while...</p>
