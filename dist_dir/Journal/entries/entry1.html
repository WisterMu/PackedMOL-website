                    First entry. Man, this is kinda cool. Anyways, I'm kinda still working out how I want this site to look like. I've been
                    working on it in between classes and I really think it's starting to shape up. Of course, there is the home page that
                    probably makes people leave right away. I love that ugly-ass banner that I made with my friends but they're scaring all
                    the hoes away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    What I <b>am</b> going to do though is make more banners and put them on different pages. These journal pages might be
                    the only place where you won't see a banner so if you need to hide from there, this is a safe place. Nowhere else in
                    this site is going to be safe. Fear it, run from it, but it is inevitable...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I'm thinking of making a different home page though that won't scare people off as much. Just dunno what it'll look like
                    yet. I still need to make more icons and an actual button for my site too. What I could do is create a button that
                    toggles the terrible banners, but that would include learning javascript...ew.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Anyways, I just wanted to put a journal entry on this page. I'm gonna wrap this up by saying you should totally follow
                    my page. It's gonna be cool, trust.
