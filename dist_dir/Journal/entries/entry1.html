                <h1>Musings on Code and Music</h1>
                    <p>
                        So...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It's been a few weeks. I've been mainly busy with school though. I'm still in Community College and it kind of bugs me,
                        just because it's like my 4th year here. I also found out in the beginning of the semester that I needed one more coding
                        class to transfer that credit to the University I want to go to. That was kinda scary. Luckily I was able to find a
                        class that wasn't filled up. <b>Unluckily</b>, the professor has a 1.5 rating in RateMyProfessor, so I'm kinda screwed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This class I had to register for was a C++ programming class. That crap is confusing. I've worked with Python and C#,
                        and none of those languages were as complicated as C++, although I've never really got the hang of those other languages
                        either. Every day I wonder if Computer Science is really for me...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Anyways, I've recently been getting a lot of edits recommended to me on Tik Tok while I was doomscrolling. I normally
                        get edits on my fyp, but these ones were to a song called <i>Drag Path by Twenty One Pilots</i>. It was the most adorable edit
                        of a pufferfish in the water. I think I teared up a little bit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After I got this edit though, I got another one of Laika, that dog that was sent to space. It was the saddest edit I've
                        ever watched. Now, I keep getting these edits all the time and I kinda love it. They range from shows I've watched to
                        certain animals doing their thing. I also saw one about humans too, that showed a bunch of cave paintings and
                        handprints. Just mentioning this because I'm now obssessed with this song of theirs, and even though it isn't available
                        for streaming anywhere, there are people who uploaded it in podcast format on Spotify. Thank goodness for that because I
                        love the song now.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Going to finish this entry off by mentioning that I <b>am</b> working on adding some actual reviews to my reviews page,
                        so keep an eye out for that. No promises they'll be any good, but they'll be there at some point.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                    First entry. Man, this is kinda cool. Anyways, I'm kinda still working out how I want this site to look like. I've been
                    working on it in between classes and I really think it's starting to shape up. Of course, there is the home page that
                    probably makes people leave right away. I love that ugly-ass banner that I made with my friends but they're scaring all
                    the hoes away.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    What I <b>am</b> going to do though is make more banners and put them on different pages. These journal pages might be
                    the only place where you won't see a banner so if you need to hide from there, this is a safe place. Nowhere else in
                    this site is going to be safe. Fear it, run from it, but it is inevitable...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    I'm thinking of making a different home page though that won't scare people off as much. Just dunno what it'll look like
                    yet. I still need to make more icons and an actual button for my site too. What I could do is create a button that
                    toggles the terrible banners, but that would include learning javascript...ew.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    Anyways, I just wanted to put a journal entry on this page. I'm gonna wrap this up by saying you should totally follow
                    my page. It's gonna be cool, trust.
                    </p>
