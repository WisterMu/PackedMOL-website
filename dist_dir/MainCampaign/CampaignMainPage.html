      <p>So like...GUYS I'M TOTALLY NORMAL ABOUT MY PLAYERS AND THIS CAMPAIGN AND EVERYTHING OMG. Ok so I started this
        campaign with a bunch of my friends back in the summer of 2022. Sessions have unfortunately slowed down to about
        once a month but we're still going strong!...I think. <br><br> Anyways, there's gonna be a lot more information
        here
        soon like people, places, and shenanigans that my players have gotten into. Maybe even future plans? <br> For
        now, if you want to get back to the main page, click <a href="https://packedmol.neocities.org/">here</a></p>
