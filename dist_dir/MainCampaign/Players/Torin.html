    <b>Name:</b> Torin Almeria<br><br>
    <b>Age:</b> ??? (20-something <br>relative to a human life)<br><br>
    <b>Pronouns:</b> He/Him<br><br>
   <br><br>
  
  Torin's a sad guy and I've been making him suffer for a majority of the campaign.<br><br>
  Evil parents, tragic brother, and he's
  just learning about the world for the first time so it's rough.
