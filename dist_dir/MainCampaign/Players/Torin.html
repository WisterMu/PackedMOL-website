  Torin's a sad guy and I've been making him suffer for a majority of the campaign.<br><br>
  Evil parents, tragic brother, and he's
  just learning about the world for the first time so it's rough.

<h2>Backstory</h2>

<p>
  Torin was raised among very apathetic and emotionally distant parents and servants. Because of this, he believed that he
  had to show himself as a worthy ruler in order to earn their love and respect. Being raised in isolation meant that
  books were often his only friends and he developed an over-the-top persona based on some villans from his stories.<br>
</p>
<p>
  One day while reading, he encountered the archfey that would soon be his patron, Veras. Veras was intruiged by Torin and
  decided to bestow some power onto him through a pact, although Torin doesn't know what the stipulations of that pact are...<br>
