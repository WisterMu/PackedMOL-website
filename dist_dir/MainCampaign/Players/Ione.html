      Ione is an orphan who's currently got "it's complicated" as her facebook relationship status. I  may be the reason behind that.

    <h2>Backstory</h2>

      <p>
          Ione was born in the rural outskirts of Dianthos. Still an infant, she was taken in by a nearby sect of Chauntea
          worshippers who raised her, alongside many other orphans, following the untimely deaths of their families to a local
          plague.<br><br>
          
          At first, this was the only life that Ione would come to know; the dull monotony of the priory, and the peaceful, yet
          achingly lonely plains it was built within.
