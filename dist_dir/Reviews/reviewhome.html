        <h2>Not a Professional</h2>
        <p>
        This page is for my thoughts on things that I've played or experienced. It's rare that I'll find content that I'm not a
        fan of so most things will be rated pretty highly here. There will still be shows or games that I found kind of terrible
        though so I'll be writing plenty about those as well. Especially shows that had terrible second seasons, or games that
        are amazing but have pretty big flaws as well. This is also an excuse for me to consume more media because I've been way
        too busy with school recently, and I've desperately been clawing for an excuse to experience more content. I have a
        heavy admiration for people who can create and share their passion with the world, and I hope that one day I can be like
        them too.

            None of the pages are created yet, but I'm working on it and they'll be there soon!
