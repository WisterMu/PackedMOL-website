          This game really needs no introduction. Ever since it came out, it has been setting new standards for the
          gaming industry for how ambitious the creators have been. The amount of content in this game is mind-blowing, and Larian
          Studios deserves their awards for their merits. It's truly a great game that I've put hundreds of hours into, and it's
          amazing how Larian Studios were able to port tabletop rules to a video game. Although it won several awards over the
          past few years, that doesn't mean that this game is flawless, far from it. There will always be bugs that could be
          ironed out, story that could be fleshed out, and content that could have been added on.
